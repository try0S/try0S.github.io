I am a first-year PhD student at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), under the supervision of [Veelasha Moonsamy](https://veelasha.org). I specialize in security research within the DFG Cluster of Excellence [“Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries“ (CASA)](https://casa.rub.de/en/).

My research focuses on the intersection of security in software-defined networking and machine learning in the data plane. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in IT-Security from Ruhr University Bochum.

Furthermore, I have valuable industry experience from my time at [G DATA CyberDefense AG](https://www.gdata.de), where I developed a method for dynamically detecting malware using Graph Neural Networks as part of my Master's thesis.

Prior to that, I was involved with [G DATA Advanced Analytics AG](https://www.gdata-advancedanalytics.de) as a working student, contributing to the development of a [vulnerability scanner](https://github.com/FHMS-ITS/MITS-Scanner/) for Health-IT infrastructure as part of the [MITSicherheit.NRW](https://mits.nrw) project.
